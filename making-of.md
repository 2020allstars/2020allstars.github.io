Notes:

In Audacity, first I use noise removal at the default settings to remove any hissing noise that may occur (normally splitting the track and then doing each channel seperately).  Then I use the compressor (again with the default settings) to make the volume levels more even.  Next, we split the tracks and set each one to mono so that the sound comes out in both ears and people can listen to the podcast with just one headphone (as of Season 3 Episode 3).  Finally, I export the pod to a joint stereo mp3 with a variable bitrate between 60 and 100 mbps.
