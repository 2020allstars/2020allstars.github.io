We are off and running with classic 2020 All-Star material in discussing Randal Grichuk's elbow injury.  Names like Aaron Hicks and Chris Coghlan are bandied about.  We move on to King Felix's troubles.  I'm a little more worried than Todd, but the more interesting discussion is should you try to move Felix if you're looking to rebuild?  Next we delve into a weird discussion about borderline playable OFs.  The name on the bottom of my list might surprise you.  Finally, Todd goes on a rant about how Billy Hamilton is actually Willy Mayes Hayes and the manager should implement a 10 pushups for every flyball rule.  It would kind of be great to watch a guy drop down and do 10 pushups during a game ala Major League, right?!?
