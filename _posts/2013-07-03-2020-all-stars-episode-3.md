On this week’s episode, we start off discussing whether Yasiel Puig should be an all-star. Then we delve into the dark world of post-hype sleepers. Finally, we end it with a little closer talk. We have mentioned Diamondbacks 6th inning guy, Will Harris, in two of our three podcasts. If this podcast ever becomes a success, I’m giving Mr. Harris all the credit.
