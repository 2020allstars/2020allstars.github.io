Closerpocalypse continues! We discuss the closer madness that has gone down this first week (Mets, Astros, Brewers, Reds, White Sox). Bottomline, we hope you didnâ€™t pay for saves towards the end of a closer-run in your draft. Next, we decide if the current drop of hot hitters are Chris Shelton (duds) or Chris Davis (studs). The results may surprise you. Finally, we talk about some potential breakout pitchers and some pitchers that we may be worried about.
