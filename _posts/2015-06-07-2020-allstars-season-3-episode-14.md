So I, David, was in Israel last week, so we missed a week.  Deep-league discussion?  It gets no deeper than this.  Pat Venditte!  Switch pitcher for the Oakland Athletics.  Is he fantasy relevant?  Not really.  But is it awesome that he can pitch from both sides?  You need to listen to find out.

We go into homer-mode and discuss the Dodgers and specifically Yasiel Puig's return to the Dodger lineup and how that affects the rest of the guys in the Dodgers outfield.  On the other hand, we chat about what the Jorge Soler injury does to the Cubs outfield.  Looks like the Cubs are also experimenting with Kris Bryant in the outfield.  More generally speaking, the Cubs strikeout a lot and we generally go into a rant about strikeout rates and guys that strike out a lot.

There are a lot of young pitchers making some noise lately.  We discuss them and rank them all relative to each other. Sticking with pitchers, we discuss the Closerpocalypse in Seattle and Tampa Bay.
