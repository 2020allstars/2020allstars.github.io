We made it past the first week. In this episode, we talk about young Dodger phenom, Yasiel Puig, a bunch of old guys on the Yankees, a discussion about the top 5 first basemen, and obviously some talk about some guys in the low minors. Last week, we had 4 listens, which means that both our parents were the only ones to listen to the podcast, but the advanced stats love our game. Enjoy!
Episode 2 (40:50)
