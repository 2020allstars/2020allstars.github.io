Welcome to the 2005 All-Stars podcast!  We discuss a lot of the old guys that are in the news this week.  Ichiro got his 3,000th hit.  Ichiro has had a sneaky good average but he's not really putting up the counting stats to be fantasy relevant.  Next we discuss the fantasy implications of the Prince Fielder news.  Mitch Moreland?  Jurkson Profar?  Joey Gallo?  

We discuss a couple hot guys in the news.  I go on a diatribe about how I don't think David Dahl is for real.  Not that he'll be bad, but his current pace feels completely unsustainable.  We give a little more love to Max Kepler.  Is he the ROY or could it be someone else?  We jump on the Joe Musgrove train.  I'm not sure who he is, but he's been pitching well recently.  We discuss the end game strategy of riding the hot hand and how you should treat the of the season.  

The Closerpocalypse has hit our first love, Wil Harris.  He lost the gig to Ken Giles after blowing a few saves and Giles looking solid.  We also love Edwin Diaz.  Is he the next Aroldis Chapman?  We like him a lot more than a guy like Kimbrel.  Adam Ottovino could be back in the chair.
