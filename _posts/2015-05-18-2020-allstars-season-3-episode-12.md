So Corey Kluber might be good.  We chat about his game for a moment and then discuss his place among the pantheon of other elite pitchers.  This leads into some concerns we have about David Price.  We discuss some potential fantasy trades with him and what we think of his value.  Continuing a pitcher discussion, we move to a former 2020 All-Star favorite, Yordano Ventura.  Is he better than some "Whack or Back"-type guys?  

The Closerpocalypse is upon us.  Neftali Feliz looks like he is out.  Shawn Tolleson seems to be the man and the guys behind the guy is Tanner Scheppers and Keone Kela.  The other guys that we are worried about are the Axman and Addison Reed.  Listen to hear what we say about their replacements.  

Finally, we scrape the bottom of the barrel in the middle infield.  

As always, check us out on Twitter [@2020AllStars](https://www.twitter.com/2020allstars) and iTunes.  In a programming note, our episode next week is up in the air because I'm going further into the future.  Hopefully, we'll get it to you, but keep abreast with us on Twitter to keep informed on when that's happening.
