We're working our way back to form.  We've got about 30 minutes of goodness for you this week.  We chat about keeper league values and specifically, selling stud pitchers for youthful bats.  Todd tends to side with the bats and I say throw something against the wall and see what happens.  The other trade pieces to offer are the once-young studs that are beginning to fade (i.e. Evan Longoria and Jay Bruce).  Really interesting to hear how our opinions differ on trading in general.  Todd tends to discount pitching and older hitters, while I conjecture that you might as well offer the deal.  What's the worst that can happen?  

In prospect talk, keep an eye on Nick Williams.  We really love this guy.  He's cut down his K-rate and still showing speed/power potential like the good version of Alex Rios.  Tyler Glasnow in the Pirates system looks like a stud pitcher in the making.  If you're looking for a deep league name for next year, check him out.  We are also fans of Julio Urias, who probably won't be up, but could make a real-life impact in September in a relief role.  

As always, check us out on Twitter [@2020AllStars](https://www.twitter.com/2020allstars) and iTunes.
