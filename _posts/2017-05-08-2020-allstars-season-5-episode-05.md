Another week, another set of big names going down.  Not sure how we got there, but we begin with Closerpocalypse.  We go through a bunch of the guys that have recently gotten saves, but may not stick around in the gig.  Crappy closers are basically our bread and butter, so listen for big names like Brad Brach, Bud Norris, and Enny Romero.  My German style "ch" with these German names is strong this week.  

I obsess over Chris Carter for no obvious reason.  The guy has done absolutely nothing this year, but that doesn't stop me from pushing him like your local used car salesman.  Not to be outdone, Todd once again pushes Kennys Vargas.  Where else are you going to get a Chris Carter vs. Kennys Vargas discussion?  

Speaking of Minnesota Twins, Todd gives us his opinion on former Yankees, Jose Berios.  We somehow jump from Berios to young guys who have been disappointing so far.  Todd tweeted about Ozzie Albies, so we discuss whether he should get in there for Dansby Swanson.  

But not all the rooks are struggling, because Cody Bellinger looks like he belongs in the bigs.  I am a bit more caustious than Todd based on an inflated average.  But he's gonna get some run and he's got the power to do some damage.  Todd tells his own story about Golfer's Elbow, so who knows how long Gonzalez will be out.  Todd's injury took 6 months to heal.  False equality or cold hard truth?  

What's the drama with Matt Harvey?  We make wild speculations about what happened and the future of Harvey and how you should handle him if he's on your squad.
