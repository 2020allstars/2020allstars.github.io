In true 2020 All-Star fashion, we have a nice little false start.  We re-begin the podcast with a discussion of Trea Turner.  He doesn't necessarily have a lot of opportunity for playing time, but he's definitely a stashable guy in keeper leagues.  We move onto the Chase Utley trade.  We don't necessarily see a lot of value, but we discuss some of the other guys that you can get.  This leads to more Dodger talk and in particular the team's bullpen situation.  

Speaking of bullpens, we bring back your favorite segment, Closerpocalypse.  We tell you that Junichi Tazawa is definitely the guy.  Of course, later in the night he blows a save is spectacular fashion.  

My roommate comes home so we quickly blast through the news of people who hit the DL.  There were a ton of guys that hit the DL, including one pitcher who hit a homer then hurt himself.  Then we just abruptly and awkwardly wrap up the whole thing.  Nothing but the best for all of you.  We apologize for those of you who enjoy our food segments.  This week we didn't get to that.
