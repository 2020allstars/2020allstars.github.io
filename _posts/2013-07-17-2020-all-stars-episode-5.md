On this week’s episode we take a look at the Futures Game. Specifically, a bunch of young arms on the American squad. Then we move on to a brief discussion where we drop our weekly Will Harris reference. Finally, we talk about bold predictions for the second half. Not “bold” like the other guys do it. This is full on crazy that may completely bust or may win you the league. Fun stuff!
