Another week, another slew of injuries.  We talk about the major injuries again, some hot starts, and of course, Closerpocalypse 2014.  Perhaps next year the fantasy baseball world should just agree to re-drafting after 2 months?  Teams, real and fantasy, are just getting decimated by injuries this year.

This week, Prince Fielder goes down for the season with a neck injury, Nolan Arenado breaks his figure, and Cliff Lee has some elbow trouble.  Our hot starts dicussion involves VMart, Dozier, Lucroy, and Josh Beckett.  Closerpocalypse saw Ronald Belasario get the gig and then proceed to implode.  Zach Britton looks to be the guy in Baltimore and the best actionable move if he’s still out there.  The flyers that we like are Daniel Webb and the artist formerly known as Leo Nunez (Juan Carlos Oviedo).

Finally, we’ve got another dogecoin contest, so listen and check that out!  Bis nächste Woche!
