Things went awry with both our team and our young pitchers.  But we begin with a chat about Yu Darvish.  Short story short, he'll be who we thought he was.  Talking of big stars, we discuss the Bryce Harper injury.  Of course, I had a similar injury so we pretend to think we know what we are talking about because something similar happened to us.  Todd loves the big name pitchers.  The beginning of this pod is all over the place.  

We go back to our bread and butter with a chat about under 50% owned guys.
