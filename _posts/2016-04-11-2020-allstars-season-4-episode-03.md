Were you interested in hearing about the 80s classic The Goonies?  Well, we went there.  But we needed something positive to talk about and baseball simply wasn't providing that positivity.  We discuss all the injuries.  The big name is Kyle Schwarber.  We discuss who on the Cubs could benefit from that.  In the outfield, we like Colby Rasmus, Nick Markakis, Michael Saunders and Drew Stubbs as possible replacements.  

Other injuries that we talk about are Robinson Chirinos, Shin-Soo Choo, Carl Crawford, and DeGrom.  On the batting side, there were a couple kids to think about.  For keeper leagues, Gary Sanchez and Wilson Conteras are interesting catchers.  In the outfield, Max Kepler nad Mallex Smith got the call and have interesting tools.  

But if you do one thing, PICK UP NICK MAZARA.  Todd thinks he's going to be an instant superstar and in his first game, he went 3 for 4 with a homer.  This guy can help you immediate, run do not walk to go pick this guy up.  Todd's bold call is ROY, future all-star, "next big thing", just do it.  Mazara's bat intrigues all the scouts.  Todd likes him as a 35hr - .300 average guy.  Perhaps not this year, but he's got that kind of potential.
