Are we panicked about the Dodgers slide?  We talk about a bunch of things that have very little to do with the fantasy baseball season.  We jump all over the place in this episode.  Probably best to just download it and then rate and review us.   

If you want one name for next year, Ronald Acuna.  He could be the next big thing.
