This week, we chat about the past weekâ€™s no-hitters and if we think those pitchers are legit.  Bottomline, we like the guys in SoCal over the guys in NorCal, whodathunkit coming from a couple kids from LA.  Specifically, we discuss whether Josh Beckett is worth a roster spot.  We talk about the Closerpocalypse in Chicago, Tampa Bay, and San Francisco.  We finish off with a chat about some deep league fodder that is new to the Show.
