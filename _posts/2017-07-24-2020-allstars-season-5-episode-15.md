We discuss the two newest young third basemen that came up this week.  Yoan Moncada and Rafael Devers were called up this week.  We actually discussed these guys a few weeks ago.  Todd thought Moncada was going to get more ABs, and I was higher on Devers...  Now?  You gotta listen to find out.  

The next subject is the injuries to big stars and their replacements.  Carlos Correa went down with a torn thumb ligament.  There are surprising a lot of guys out there to talk about as replacements on the wire and even on the Astros themselves.  

Final subject... oldie but goodie, Closerpocalypse.
