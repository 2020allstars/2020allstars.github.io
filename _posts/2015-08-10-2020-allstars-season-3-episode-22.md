This week is pretty special.  We're going back in time to check out some of our predictions from our [inaugural episode of Season 3](http://2020allstars.da3.net/2015/02/15/2020-allstars-season-3-episode-01/).  Below are the notes that we are referring to:

***  
D: Miguel Cabrera will be a "bust" - Either .275 hitter or "is good but plays only 110 games"  

D: Anthony Rizzo is the #1 overall 1B.  10 steal speed.  

T: Robinson Cano is going to have another rough season.  15-18 hr season.  "behind Rendon and possibly Jose Altuve"  

D: "I like Kipnis.  I would buy Kipnis."  

T: Top 5 2Bs some conglomeration of "Rendon, Altuve, Cano, Kinsler, Kipnis, and perhaps Dee Gordon sneaks in there."  

D: "Bryce Harper or Josh Donaldson as jumping into the top 25"  

D: "I wouldn't be surprised if Jorge Soler jumped into the top 25"  

D: "Are you really taking Nelson Cruz over [Jorge Soler]?"  

T: "Yasmany Tomas could jump into the top 25"  

T: "We love Kyle Schwarber"  

T: "What do you think about this Kang guy?"  

T: "He might be the best middle infielder [on the all Asian team]"  

T: "I'm not sure the 40 homers are going to translate directly to the MLB"  

D: "I'd rather have a guy like Jed Gyorko or Andrelton Simmons"  

T: "I was all over Xander Boegarts and I can't quit him.  He completes me.  .280 25 homer bat."  

T: "Not a big fan of Pedroia, Panda, Hanley or Napoli"  

T + D: "I think Pedroia will be droppable by the end of the year"  

D: "Pedroia at 2B or Wright at 3B?"  
T: "Can I take neither?"  

T: "Brett Lawrie: 15-20 pop, 15-20 speed, .280" (38/10/45/5/.268 now)  

D: "Switch hitting superstar, Chase Headley"  

D: "They're not going to give the reigns to ARod again, are they?"  
T: "No, I don't see that at all"  

Dogebet: Lawrie vs Headley  

T: "This is the year for Jed Gyroko.  I'm all-in on him.  .265, 30 hrs"  

T: "SD has 4 players with more than 25 hrs"   

D: "Khris Davis gets to 30 hrs"  

T: "Does Khris Davis hit over .238?"  
D: "No, no, probably not." (he's hitting .237 right now)  

D: "20/20 season for Gardner"  

T: "I think Charlie Blackmon is for real"  

T: "Travis Snider hits 25+ hrs"  

T: "[Schwarber] is going to have video game numbers in the minors"  

D: "Impact rookie will be Kris Bryant"  
T: "Yea, we were already all over him last year"  

T: "Joc Pederson can have a big impact.  He's got 20/20 type talent.  The 40/40 was a PCL mirage."  

T: "Aaron Sanchez is a guy that I like"  

T: "I think Harvey is going to be a star.  3.30, 8.5K/9, 1.23 WHIP"  

T: "Jose Fernandez comes back around July 15th"
