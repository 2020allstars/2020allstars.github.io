Short and sweet folks.  We talk about some September call ups that you might want to look at especially if youâ€™ve got the need, the need for speed.  Post-deadline trades?  We have you covered.  Then a mini-discussion about young arms and whether they should be in the bullpen or in the rotation.  Yup, super gut and under 31 minutes.
