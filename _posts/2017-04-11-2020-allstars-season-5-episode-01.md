We kick off a bit of rust with the first episode of the season.  Mostly chatting about old flames such as Wil Myers and George Springer.  Was it our best effort?  Best of 2017 so far is how I'd describe it...  

We get into a discussion about the Padres for way longer than we should.  We talk about a bunch of young pitchers such as James Paxton and Dylan Bundy.  Ending things with the Closerpocalypse, which is starting early this year.
