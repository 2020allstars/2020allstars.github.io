Alright, you waited.  Then you waited some more.  Then?  Well, we finally made a podcast!  But it wasn't what we said it was about because we waited so long.  Instead we discuss the offseason moves and how we predict those will affect things next year.

On a fun programming note, this was the first podcast Todd and I did in person.  Not sure when the next one will be but this was a good experience.  Also, I posted this 3 weeks after we made it.  But luckily nothing has changed in that time.
