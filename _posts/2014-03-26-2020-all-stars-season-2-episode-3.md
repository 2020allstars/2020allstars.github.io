How’s it going?  Not well, if you are a Texas Ranger, a Texas Ranger fan, or a fantasy owner with a Texas Ranger.  We discuss the injury woes of that particular organization and the fantasy implications of all the injuries.  Next we introduce “Closerpocylpse”, which will probably become a weekly segment on the latest news in crappy closers gaining or losing the closing job.  Finally, we end with a discussion of fifth starters that may be fantasy relevant.  If you are in a 10 team mixer with shallow benches, you might want to listen to the other podcasts that tireless tell you that Mike Trout will be good.  Yea, we get it.  But that’s not gonna help the other 9 teams in the league.
