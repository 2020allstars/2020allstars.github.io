What to do about Adam Wainwright?  In typical 2020 All-Star fashion, we talk about guys that are nowhere near his caliber, but that's what you've come to expect from us.  A change of pace, we discuss old guys that you could replace him with in an impromptu Whack or Back.  Our love affair with former UCLA superstar, Trevor Bauer, bubbles to the surface.  Another big name that we're worried about is Iwakuma.  Without any evidence, we really suspect something more than meets the eye is here.

We also discuss some middle infield names.  Seems like there are a lot of buzzy names in the middle infield, but not anyone actually really great.  What to do with former #1 overall player, Tim Beckham.  Yea, the other podcasters are not talking about this guy, but that's why you're here.

Todd had to go so we have a super awkward ending to this with the Closerpocalypse.  Joe Nathan went down.  Chad Qualls is back in the circle of trust.  Miguel Castro might not be long for the gig as closer.

Breaking News... man, this podcast was bootleg.  There are self-made sound effects, jump cuts, really, it's all there.  We even have a bonus five minutes for you after the gong.  Check it out!
