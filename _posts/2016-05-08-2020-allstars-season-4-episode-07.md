Mother's Day podcast.  Like the pod, I'll make this summary quick hitting.

Garrett Richards goes down with a torn UCL.  The super sleeper name that Todd likes is Nate Smith.  Another guy in the minors that Todd likes is James Taillon.  Of course, the rest of the internet is on the Tyler Glasnow train.  Glasnow has a higher K-rate but also a much higher BB rate.  I just worry that people fall in love with Glasnow's physique and really discount the control issues.  

We quickly discuss who could be the #1 overall fantasy pick next year.  Arrenado, Stanton, Altuve are all in the mix on the hitting side and Kershaw or Arrieta on the pitching side.  

Apologies to [Heath Capps](https://www.twitter.com/HeathCapps) whose name escaped me during the podcast.  He is ready to move on from Adam Jones.  I asked him about Yelich and Todd and I surprisingly take Yelich over a few big names players out there.
