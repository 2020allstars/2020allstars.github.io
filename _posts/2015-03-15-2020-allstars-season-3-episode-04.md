The technical difficulties episode.  You came for fantasy baseball chatter, but you're staying for the paella.  We begin this podcast with a mini-food segment about everyone's favorite Spanish rice dish.  Then we gush over how good Kris Bryant is and where he might go in your dynasty league's draft.  Next we answer the following questions:

* Does Jayson Werth's injury scare us?  Yea, a little.  
* The CarGo question.  Is he good and do you want to pay for him?  Really interesting thoughts there.  
* What does the Marcus Stroman injury mean for the rest of the Toronto rotation?  Although a big loss, we think Toronto can weather the blow.

Finally, we wander around aimless for a couple minutes before deciding that we should end the podcast.  We hope you are enjoying the podcast.  Feel free to get in touch with us on twitter [@2020Allstars](https://twitter.com/2020allstars) and don't forget to subscribe on itunes below.
