We had an extended break, so there is a ton of news to talk about.  Unfortunately, a lot of it is bad.  We go over the rash of Tommy John surgeries that have swept through the league and what the fantasy/keeper implications are with those.  Then we swing to the positive and look at the surprises of spring training.  Finally, we end it with a short discussion about a new 10-team mixer that we joined.
