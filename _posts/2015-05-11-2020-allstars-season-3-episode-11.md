Bryce Harper is living up to the hype.  We briefly discuss his 6 homer week.  The guy is still 23 years old and the sky is the limit.  

We also talk about the big name pitchers that are off to slow starts.  Is Kershaw somehow a buy-low candidate?  Todd still thinks he'll be the best pitcher in baseball.  Jordan Zimmermann's struggles have us a little more worried.  Chris Sale is another guy that's run into some tough luck in the early going.  

Kris Bryant is well on his way to passing Barry Bonds on the all time homer list.  Yes, it took him 21 games to get his first one, but obviously he's going to hit 100 the rest of the way.  Todd is a little bit less optimistic than I, but we'll see.  It'll be interesting to see where he goes the rest of the year.  Who is the NL ROY, Kris Bryant or Joc Pederson?  Todd is drinking so much of the Joc Pederson Koolaid that his judgement might be mildly clouded.  The good news is that Joc Pederson might be Babe Ruth.  

Sticking with the young guys, we discuss the crop of young middle infielders that have become fantasy relevant.  We then move onto young pitchers and finally end the podcast with the Closerpocalypse.
