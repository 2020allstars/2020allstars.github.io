Bad puns kicks off our discussion.  James Shields got traded to the White Sox.  The only thing that it really tells us is that the White Sox are in it to win it.  Perhaps they'll bring up Tim Anderson to replace Jimmy Rollins at SS, but the prospects in the deal are lotto tickets.  Perhaps in 2020 we'll be talking about Fernando Tatis Jr, but he's certainly not a sure thing.  

A lot of the prospects that we have been chatting about the past couple of months.  Trea Turner has been freed and he's batting 1.000.  How can they send this guy down?  We love Trea, but could there be someone we like more?  A blast from the past in Texas has made his way up to the bigs.  Yes, I have been all over Turner, but even I admit this mystery man might have a better opportunity than my boy, Trea.  But both guys have the potential to make an impact on fantasy teams this year.  Prince Fielder owners might have something to worry about.  

The stars of the last generation are falling one by one.  The Dodgers DFA'd Carl Crawford, which opens up a spot for our boy, Trayce Thompson.  Guys that we put in the Trayce Thompson ballpark are Wil Myers and Corey Dickerson.  Byron Buxton is back in the bigs after absolutely annihilating the baseball.  He's still striking out too much, but the potential is on display.  Meadering on through shortstops around the league leads us to the vanguard of the Alex Bregman era!  Let's make this happen.  Get on the Twitter machine and let's get #FreeAlexBregman going.
