Hi everyone, we have a great episode for you.  We put our two cents into the Kris Bryant discussion.  Bottomline, I love him and Todd has more tempered expectations.  The world knows about Bryant, but how do you take advantage of this?  We suggest some names that you could offer him for if you have already drafted.  Buy the rumor, sell the hype.  

This is the 2020 All-Stars, so we discuss some deeper names that we are looking at in our draft.  Which Alex Rios shows up this year?  We discuss him for a bit and we actually drafted him in the 4th non-keeper round (192nd pick).  Editors note, we really underestimated how far pitchers would fall this year.  Man, we thought Paxton could be a 20th rounder and he went in the 23rd round.  Want a real deep-leaguer?  Toni Cingrani middle reliever!  We annoint him Johnny Venters 2.0.  

Next, we have a mini-closerpocalypse session.  What do y'all think of Brett Cecil?  We like him and I hope he does well, because we got him in the 3rd non-keeper round (180th).  

We basically drafted half the guys that we talked about.  So hopefully we're right on these guys.
