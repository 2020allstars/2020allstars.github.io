He is who we thought he was!  Jorge Soler!  He came.  He saw.  He popped a homer.  We discuss Jorge Soler’s comps.  We also talk about Kennys Vargas and find some really interesting comps for him.

Then we get into our first semi-heated debate of the 2020 Allstars.  We have our own opinions on a certain LA Dodger and can’t seem to agree on how good he is.

Then we discuss some of the trades that have gone down and how we are just not as smart as some of the better GMs out there.
