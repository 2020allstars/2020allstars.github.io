We begin with Closerpocalypse 2014.  Although things are not so bad this time.  There were a couple trades so we discuss the fantasy implications of those.  Who are our second half studs?  We like a couple of guys in new situations, some guys in old situations, some guys we don’t agree on.  A little bit of everything.

We are going to try to be a little more active on The Twitter so hopefully you’ll follow us there.

Bis nächstes mal!  Tscüss!
