We are back for the 2015 season!  We start off the year with a discussion of sleepers and busts.  We love everyone who plays on Chicago.  We don't love anyone in Seattle.  There are big names that we don't love and some no-names that we do.  But that's pretty much par for the course around here.

We even discuss coaching changes and bringing in the walls in Citi Field.  We had a plan but it is clear we need Spring Training to get back into the groove.

Also, just wanted to tell you all that we're going to try to be more active on Twitter this year.  Check us out at [@2020AllStars](http://twitter.com/2020AllStars).  If you have any questions, we'll try to answer them all there.

Cheers!
