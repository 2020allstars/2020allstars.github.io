The big news of the week was Starling Marte getting slammed with an 80-day PED suspension.  We discuss what to do with him, what are the long-term ramifications of this?  In what types of leagues do you keep Marte and where can you let him loose?  Also we do some replacement talk, although with a guy of Marte's caliber, you're not gonna find someone on the wire to solve all your problems.  Travis Jankowski and Jarrod Dyson are the speed guys that we mention.  If you're fishing for upside, Austin Meadows is an interesting name.  His profile is what has the scouts drooling, but his numbers aren't bananas.  

The news that affects us is Marcus Semien's broken wrist.  Todd threw out a couple of nice sleeper names that you'll want to listen for.  I have my doubts about Jose Peraza, so we chat about the Reds situation for a bit.  

Our favorite topic, Closerpocalypse, rears it's ugly head.  Matt Bush looks to be the guy in Texas.  Zach Britton got hurt and Brad Brach looks to be the guy.  The National's situation is dicey; Todd thinks it's Kelley and I'm in the Koda Glover camp.  Which crappy closer would you want?
