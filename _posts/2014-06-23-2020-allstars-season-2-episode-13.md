We are back and in true 2020 Allstars fashion, we go all over the place.  But luckily, the week in fantasy baseball was mostly good.  We begin with a discussion of vacation spots along the Adriatic for those looking for a summer getaway.  Next, we discuss Clayton Kershaw’s no-hitter and his status among other pitchers in fantasy baseball.  We move to discussing whether Matt Kemp is “back”.

Who is the #1 2B in fantasy baseball?  This is a question that we discuss at length and the answer may surprise you.  As this is the 2020 Allstars, we wander a bit into minor league players whom you should look out for.  Somehow from there, we start discussing the Tampa Bay Rays.  As for our final fantasy baseball subject, we talk about Closerpocalypse 2014.
