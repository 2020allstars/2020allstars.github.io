We chat about the Astros lastest call up.  Derek Fisher has had a monster season in the minors this year, but is this sustainable?  Is he a legit 25/25 guy?  Todd worries that the steals won't translate to the bigs, but I'm more optimistic.  We compare Fisher with our favorite rookie, Cody Bellinger.  Which leads to the AGon injury.  We are very worried about his prospects for the rest of the season, but that is good for the Dodgers prospects.
