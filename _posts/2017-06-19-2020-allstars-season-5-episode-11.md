Pretty quiet week, so we chat about pitchers young and old.  Alex Wood vs Jose Berrios vs any random name we can think of.  We also rehash a bunch of articles on Fangraphs this week.  Like we said, it was slow.  Another subject on the docket is how has the flyball era effected how pitchers pitch.  Finally, we touch on the current Closerpocalypse.  Good times.
