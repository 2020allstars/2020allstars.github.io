Turner vs Bregman.  Todd likes Turner's steals potential and the general lack of steals in the league.  Turner is definitely the burner of the two, but I'm worried about his OBP.  Bregman is finally turning it on and Bregman has shown his potential to be a high average guy.  The lineups of both guys look like they'll be solid and we're split on this so take your choice.  We ponder if Billy Hamilton could get 100 steals next year.  We both agree that the second coming of Vince Coleman would be awesome.  

Our earlier discussion winds it way into something about steals and the middle infield in general.  But there are just a ton of options out there.  Todd is ready to crown Corey Seager as the next big thing.  Number 1 Shortstop 2017.  I don't believe it but I do like Seager.  We discuss all the other SS's as well.  Speaking of #1, we discuss if Mookie Betts should be the #1 overall pick.
