The big news in the past couple days is the Madison Bumgarner's dirt bike injury.  Blessing in disguise?  Cheap young talent on the wire to replace him?  We discuss these topics.  

Once again, we chat about closers.  Same song, different verse, only this time just a little bit worse.  

In case you weren't tuning out early, we stepped up the non-sense with catcher talk.  Robery Chirinos, Jett Bandy, ... need I say more?  

In small sample size theater, we discuss Eric Thames.  Who is Eric Thames?  We think we know who he is.
