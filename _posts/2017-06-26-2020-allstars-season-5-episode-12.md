We talk about the Julio Urias injury.  He's got a shoulder injury and he done.  Pretty much a drop everywhere and we discuss possible replacements.  Rick Porcello vs Alex Cobb, Trevor Bauer vs Mike Montgomery, Andrew Moore, Dutch Oven... does that sound exciting?  Hey, it's bleak out there.  

On the offensive side, we chat Judge vs Bellinger.  We are squarely in the Bellinger but Todd throws out the first rounder talk.  Where does Bellinger rank among the league's elite first basemen?  I'm not ready to crown him, but Todd's take is coming in hot.  On the Judge side, we both agree on selling the hype.  Are any of these guys as good as Matt Adams?  ha, jk.  

We end the pod with Closerpocalypse.  Alright, enjoy!
