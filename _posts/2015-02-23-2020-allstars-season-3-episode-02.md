Episode 2 of the 2015 season... honestly, not much to talk about.  But we somehow filled up 45 minutes with nonsense and misinformation.  There was even talk about BJ Upton's name change.  Closerpocalypse is upon us once again.  We discuss a lot of Dodger news including the "big" injury to Kenley Jansen.  We are relatively worried about this injury.  Basically, we just don't want to have to pay for Jansen when we could get someone cheaper in a later round.  We have no idea who the replacement is but if you need a name, we went with Brandon League.  Also in Dodger land, we discuss Greinke's oiling his elbow.

We discuss a bunch of deep league guys like Mike Moustakas, Billy Butler, and James Loney.  Is Steven Souza legit?  We wander around this question for a bit and about the Tampa Bay's offense in general.  We were struggling to talk about anything.  We end off with a Dalton Pompei vs Anthony Gose vs Jarrod Dyson in a "last round speed only" guy.

Enjoy it!
