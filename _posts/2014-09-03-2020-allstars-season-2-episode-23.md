What the heck is happening to pitchers?  They aren’t getting hurt anymore, but a lot of big names are getting hit hard lately.  We discuss whether you should worry about these guys and throw out some names of guys that you might want to consider in lieu of the bigger names.

Speaking of big names, we delve into the topic of name-value vs. production-value.  There are a lot big names that we think you should avoid unless you can get a good value on them.  Again, we don’t think these guys will kill your team, but for the price, you can find better value.  The alternatives are bandied about for your listening pleasure.

Thanks for sticking with us this far and hope to see you guys for the rest of the season.

Tschüssi!
