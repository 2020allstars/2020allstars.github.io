Angels in the outfield and the infield!  We discuss the big moves by the Angels.  They added Justin Upton and Brandon Philips to their offense and Houston added Justin Verlander.  But we also waste a lot of time on smaller deals like Cameron Maybin and Mike Cameron's son.  Don't worry, we keep it obscure.  We also discuss the recent surge by Byron Buxton.  I'll ruin the suspense.  Todd still believes.  I still don't believe.  Fool me once...
