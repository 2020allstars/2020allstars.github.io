Trout.  Thumb.  Us.  Tears.  

That's pretty much the first 10 minutes of the podcast.  We discuss waiver wire guys that are out there, but none of these guys are Trout.  Not even close.  So yea, probably best to just replace Trout with tears.  The big question is: Is Mike Trout gettable now?  If someone is in a win now mode, Todd thinks that Trout is gettable.  

We discuss pitchers next.  David Price is back and we give our thoughts on him.  Todd seems more optimistic than I am.  Todd ambushes me with some recent call ups.
