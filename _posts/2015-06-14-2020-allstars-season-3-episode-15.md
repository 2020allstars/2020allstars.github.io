Ok guys, this is becoming a food podcast.  For the first three minutes, we discuss making french fries, pommes frites, whatever you call them, from scratch and then turning those into the Quebecois specialty, Poutine.  

As for actual fantasy baseball talk, we discuss the recent call-ups.  What do we expect of Byron Buxton, Francisco Lindor, and Joey Gallo?  Also, who is next to be called up (#freekyleschwarber)?  There's more but perhaps you should just listen instead of reading about it.  :-)  

As always, check us out on Twitter [@2020AllStars](https://www.twitter.com/2020allstars) and iTunes.
