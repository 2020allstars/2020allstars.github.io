The big news of the week was the Alex Rios trade.  Next the chatter moves to a couple young guys that are getting the call that might be of interest on your squads down the line.  Fawning over Eric Hosmer follows that and of course we ride the closer carousel.  We end it all with further discussion of how far Yasiel Puig can go for this year and in the future.
