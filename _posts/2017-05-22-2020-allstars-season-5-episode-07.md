Was this our best effort?  ... Ã½ou can be the judge.  We chat about Julio Urias.  He had another bad outing and was sent back to the minors.  Todd still has the faith and believes this guy will still a be a star.  But for a keeper league, we discuss whether you should hold onto him.  But it's not all bad news, we discuss some guys that have been pretty good lately and what we expect from them in the future.  

What's going on this week in the nation's capitol?  We discuss the closer situation and we're definitely not in agreement on this.  Koda Glover looks to be the guy right now, but we suspect that's going to change.  

Todd is worried about Joc Pederson.  Note this was before his collision with Puig.  Speaking of worried, we discuss some stalwarts that are off to a slow start.
