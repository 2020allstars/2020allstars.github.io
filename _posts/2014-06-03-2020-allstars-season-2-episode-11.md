We are back.  Time certainly flies quickly, doesn’t it?  This week we talk about a rash of injuries (again) and some guys that you can pick up as replacements.  Next we talk about the Closerpocalypse.  Some guys seem to be tightening their grasp on formerly shaky situations and other situations are falling apart.  We also go into good middle relievers and whether you want those guys instead of the a shaky closer.  We kept it short this week because of family stuff, but we’ll be back next week.  See you soon!
