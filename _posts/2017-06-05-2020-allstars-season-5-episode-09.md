Off-topic is the name of the game this week.  We get a little political, although don't worry, it's still our wacky takes on things.  The environment, gender equality, basketball... there just isn't a lot going on in baseball, so we stray.  Hey, what can you do?  

We start off with our favorite subject, the Dodgers.  The outfield started off hot and now looks a bit like a dumpster fire.  Todd suggests that Ryan Braun could make his way to the City of Angels.  Matt Adams has had two good games, so we visit the short sample size theater.  Speaking of the short sample size theater...

David Price had a good second game.  Todd is ready to crown him.  I'm actually ready to sell.  We throw out a bunch of names but can't really put a good value on Price.
