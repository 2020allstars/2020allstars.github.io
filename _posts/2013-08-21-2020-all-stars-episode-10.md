What do you do if you had Jose Bautista?  We don’t know, but that doesn’t stop us from giving you our opinion.  The Mike Trout injury worries us a little bit (aka we are terrified).  Xander Bogaerts got the call!  Todd remises about the the next great offensive shortstop era.  Then for the main event, we create the all-time all-asian/asian-american fantasy team.  It’s silliness that won’t help you now, but hey, we are who we said we are.
