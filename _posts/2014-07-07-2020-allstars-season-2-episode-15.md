We begin our week with 1Bs for the second half including a big name that we are down on.  Namely, we discuss Brandon Belt vs a slew of names.  Spoiler, we like Belt.  Then we move on to what to do with Cliff Lee, will he come back strong or is it time to sell?  There is a bit of discussion about our favorite topic, Closerpocalypse 2014.  Hopefully, you moved on my Santiago Casilla suggestion as he was announced as the guy on Sunday.

Onto the big trade this week.  You would think we would have a long segment about Oakland and Chicago, but instead we meander into a discussion of the 1977 Dodgers.  Thatâ€™s what happens when you get a couple kids from LA talking baseball.
