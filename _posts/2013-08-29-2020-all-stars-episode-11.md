It’s a dark day in fantasy and real baseball.  We stay strong and hold back our tears for Matt Harvey’s torn elbow, but just barely.  We babble about possible replacements, but our dispair is thinnly vailed.  Next, we move on to some young guys that are getting called up.  And that’s pretty much it.  Hope y’all like it and remember to sign up to our podcast on iTunes.

Episode 11 (30:55)
