Another week, another rash of injuries.  We talk about how hits the dl this week, but the news is not all bad.  There were also a bunch of people coming off the DL and one particularly interesting situation where a star has gained some useful position flexibility.  We end off the pod with discussion of Closerpocalypse 2014.  Itâ€™s the nightmare that you never wake up from.
