This episode we begin with a little trade talk.  Xander Bogaerts just got a little more interesting.  We also discuss the Albert Pujols injury and the future of Pujols in fantasy leagues.  Obviously we have a small bit about closers.  Finally, we’ve peppered the podcast with talk about German white wines, so we’ve really covered it all.  Bis bald!
