The real all-star team has been announced and we discuss the surprises.  Where there is Smoak, there is fire!  We discuss Yonder Alonso vs Justin Smoak and who we think is more for real / more surprising.  We also discuss the return of Freddie Freeman once again.  In the NL, we discuss the middle infielders that were surprises.  Later on in the pod, we continue with post-hype guys like Kevin Gausman.

We then meander around the subject of a bunch of speed guys.  Billy Hamilton, Elvis Andrus, Brent Gardner, Dee Gordon, Trea Turner.  

The kids are coming up.  We discuss the two big outfielders that got the call, Nick Williams and Clint Frazier.  

Lastly, Closerpocalyse.  Same ole, same ole.
