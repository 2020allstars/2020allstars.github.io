This week we chat about the Tulo injury and possible replacements.  Is Josh Rutledge the answer?  Is Danny Santana?  Is crying into your pillow going to do it?  Probably all three.  In positive news, an old friend is coming back to the NL West.

We also openly worry about the situations in KC and Houston.  There is more talk about the minor league system in Chicago.  Closerpocalypse?  No, but we do talk about a potential trade in Philly that could bring a new closer to the forefront.  Then some east coast / west coast trades.  Will some of the big names go across the country?
