Well, the reprieve is over.  Closerpocalypse is BACK!  We saw a lot of shaky performances this week and a lot of potential injuries in the backend of bullpens this week.  We go through all of them and give you our thoughts on who we like going forward.  Also for those people playing in leagues that give you points for incredible facial hair, we have some insights for you as well.

Next we talk about some of the pitching injuries.  Should you hold onto these guys or are there other names out there?

Last we talk about a few guys that have been hot and a few guys whose ship may have sailed (at least for this year).

Alright, remember to check us out on twitter @2020Allstars.  Tsch√ºssi!
