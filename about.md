  You want to know about us, eh?
</p>

The origins of the 2020 All-Stars is simple.  We used to talk on the phone for hours about our fantasy baseball team.  Occasionally, we'd feel like we said something useful and wish we'd recorded it for our own sakes so we could tell everyone else how brilliant we were.  So what did we do?  We recorded our calls.  Voil√°!  The 2020 Allstars was born.

We try to focus on deep league names and especially minor leaguers that won't come up for a while.  It doesn't mean that we ignore all the big names, but it's not our true passions.
